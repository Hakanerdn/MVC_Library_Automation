## Overview

The Library Automation System is a web-based application designed to manage and maintain records of book-related transactions within an institutional library. It offers a user-friendly interface and leverages a Layered Architecture structure along with Entity Framework and the MVC (Model-View-Controller) library. The system adopts a "Code First" approach for database management, ensuring data accuracy and efficient operations.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this system are as follows:

1. **Member Management**
   - Register, list, search, delete, and edit library members.
   
2. **Book Management**
   - Register, list, search, delete, and edit books in the library collection.

3. **User Authentication**
   - Implement user login, registration, and password recovery functionalities.

4. **User Actions**
   - View user actions and interactions within the system.

5. **Authorization**
   - Grant and manage various levels of user authorizations and permissions.

6. **Transaction Handling**
   - Facilitate book issuance and return operations, ensuring accuracy and accountability.

7. **Additional Sections**
   - Create and utilize sections like Contact, About Us, and Announcements to enhance user experience.

## Technologies and Tools

The Library Automation System is developed using the following technologies and tools:

- HTML and CSS for the user interface
